Welcome to Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros.[b] is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they traverse the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from King Koopa (later named Bowser).
